### This is a journal laying out the context of my thoughts, how I arrived at certain assumptions and clarification on my intentions and motivations.

It is my assumption that by recognising the things we share in common we make space to discover everything that make us unique and that by better understanding others we understand ourselves. I take the term ‘Globally orientated citizenship’ from Bhikhu Parekh which I discovered while researching this idea. It is not about making everyone and everywhere look the same, but rather about making people conscious of the shared resources and responsibilities we all have across the globe, the only place we have to call our home.

It is also my assumption at the time of writing that by putting our trust in mathematics and our knowledge in to the laws of the universe we place the focus our efforts on the areas of *education* rather than *marketing* and *work* rather than *speculation* by making the entropy and uncertainty of the universe work for us rather than against us.

This idea first came to me back in August in the Bitcoin Squat with Drak from Viacoin and Peter Todd. I then saw an opportunity when I was inspired by Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof on the World Crypto Network here: http://youtu.be/OAPhWPcl6tg?t=46m30s

Instead of placing value in prediction making which incentivises the manipulation of information and the rewriting of the past instead we place value in the ability to deliver over time regardless of our predictions and recognise that while there is no downside to having a hypothesis it’s main use is in helping us learn more about our ability to learn rather than the subject matter itself. Too many lack belief in themselves and then take it out on other people who end up shouldering the burden all by themselves.

This creates a system in which the weakest rise to the top while the strongest most resilient remain trapped at the bottom. As the economy creates more wealth it creates more poverty. The only reason the poverty persists is because the poor are able to endure it which is a testament to their resilience and a key signal we can use to bring them the justice necessary to put an end to devouring kings.

This isn’t so much about citizenship as it is about giving every person on this planet the right of way. The right to exist, the freedom of movement and passage across the land. It’s about sharing our knowledge and trust of each other even when we are not there to witness it for ourselves. By grounding ourselves in mathematics and physics we give every person everywhere the strongest foundation we have; our best effort equal opportunity to prove their existence and authenticity.

Global Citizen Passport Meetups are instituted by their adherence to open standards rather than to a brand or company. 

We prove the location of the venue by using Bitcoin Addresses belonging to business which is hosting the event. By broadcasting a transaction from a pre-existing address paid in to by customers of the business and by exposing their IP address to the Bitcoin Network they reveal their location at that point in time. Because the business has a commercial interest in protecting its reputation we should trust that they are at the location they tell us they are. By spending from a public address that has been used by previous customers of the business we add further traceability for evidential reasons. The transaction they will broadcast contains a PGP Signed digest of the passport’s contents including the merkle root of the latest block to prove that the media content itself was generated at that time no sooner than the block with the corresponding merkle root. 

By timestamping a signed sha256 digest in the blockchain we not only prove that the document existed at that time but we are also understanding the blockchain as a globally distributed database.

We then have several options on how the passport’s contents is propagated around the world. We can link it to a social networking site like https://keybase.io/chrisellis and we can even zip it up and put it on BitTorrent. This would then facilitate the verification of extended social media identities and would diminish the decency many citizens have on government and legal services.
